## 🎯 How the Game Works

- The game board consists of a 3×3 grid.
- Players take turns clicking on empty cells.
- Each click places an **X** or **O** on the board.
- After every move, the game checks for:
  - A winning combination
  - A draw condition
- A reset option allows players to restart the game.
